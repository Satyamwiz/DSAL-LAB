# SPPU Data Structures and Algorithms Lab Assignments

Programming Assignments of Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), Second Year (SE) Computer Engineering (CE), Data Structures and Algorithms Lab (DSAL) 2022-23.

## Question 1

Beginning with an empty binary search tree, Construct binary search tree by inserting
the values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree -
- Insert new node, 
- Find number of nodes in longest path from root, 
- Minimum data value found in the tree, 
- Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at every node, 
- Search a value.

## Question 2

Beginning with an empty binary tree, Construct binary search tree by inserting
the values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree, perform the
following operations on it -
1. Perform inorder, preorder and postorder traversal
2. Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at every node
3. Find the height of the tree
4. Copy this tree to another tree (operator =)
5. Count number of leaves, number of internal nodes
6. Erase all nodes in a binary tree

(implement both recursive and iterative methods)

## Question 3

Create an inordered threaded binary tree. Perform inorder, preorder traversals without 
recursion and deletion of a node.
Analyze time and space complexity of algorithm.

## Question 4

Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table
implementation to quickly look up client‘s telephone number. Make use of two collision
handling techniques and compare them using number of comparisons required to find a
set of telephone numbers.

## Question 5

Implement all the functions of a dictionary (ADT) using open
hashing technique: separate chaining using linked list Data: Set of
(key, value) pairs, Keys are mapped to values, Keys must be
comparable, and Keys must be unique. Standard Operations: Insert
(key, value), Find(key), Delete(key)

## Question 6

Represent a given graph using adjacency matrix/list to perform DFS and using adjacency list to 
perform BFS. Use the map of the area around the college as the graph. 
Identify the prominent land marks as nodes and perform DFS and BFS on that.

## Question 7

You have a business with several offices; you want to lease phone lines
to connect them up with each other; and the phone company charges
different amounts of money to connect different pairs of cities. You
want a set of lines that connects all your offices with a minimum total
cost. Solve the problem by suggesting appropriate data structures.

## Question 8

Given sequence k = k1 <k2 < … < kn of n sorted keys, with a search
probability pi for each key ki . Build the Binary search tree that has
the least search cost given the access probability for each key.

## Question 9 

A dictionary stores keywords and its meanings. Provide facility for adding new keywords, deleting keywords,
 updating values of an entry. Provide facility to display whole data in sorted Ascending / Descending order.
 Also find out how many comparisons are required for finding any entry. Use height balance tree and find
 complexity for finding a keyword.
 
## Question 10 

Implement the Heap Sort algorithm demonstrating the Heap / Shell data structure with 
modularity of programming language.
